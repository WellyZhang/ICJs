# Introduction

ICJs, or _Interpretive Cpp for JavaScript_, is a course project submitted to _Principles of Programming Methodology_, _Zhejiang University_.

In the project, we use pure **C++** to generate a _naive_ parser for the programming language of **JavaScript**. Please don't expect it to possess advanced JavaScript features: implementing a naive version takes us a whole lot of time!
